## Get it working on your machine
1. Clone this repository

2. Install [Elm](http://elm-lang.org)

3. Install Elm stuff
```bash
elm package install
```

4. Install elm-test

Because elm-test isn't available as regular binary, you'll need Node and install it via NPM.
```bash
npm install -g elm-test
```

5. Run Elm stuff
```bash
elm-reactor
```

6. Run tests
```bash
elm-test
```
Add the `--watch` flag if you want them to be continuously run.

Happy Hacking!
